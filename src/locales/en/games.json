    "gameRules": "Game Rules",
    "nBackRule1": "A sequence of visual stimuli will appear one at a time.",
    "nBackRule2": "Your task is to identify when the current stimulus matches the one that appeared N positions earlier in the sequence.",
    "nBackRule3": "Press the 'Match' button when you detect a match, or 'No Match' when there isn't one.",
    "nBackRule4": "The value of N determines the difficulty - higher N values require you to remember stimuli further back in the sequence.",

    "nBackTip1": "Start with N=1 or N=2 if you're new to this type of exercise.",
    "nBackTip2": "Try to maintain a steady rhythm as you respond to help with timing.",
    "nBackTip3": "Regular practice with increasing difficulty levels will yield the best results.",
    
    "difficultyLevels": "Difficulty Levels",
    "nBackDifficultyEasy": "Suitable for beginners. You only need to remember the immediately previous stimulus.",
    "nBackDifficultyMedium": "The standard level. You need to remember what appeared 2 steps back.",
    "nBackDifficultyHard": "Challenging level requiring significant working memory capacity.",
    "nBackDifficultyExpert": "Expert level that pushes the limits of working memory.",
    
    "scienceBackground": "The Science Behind N-Back",
    "nBackScience1": "The N-Back task was developed by Wayne Kirchner in 1958 and has since become a standard measure of working memory in cognitive psychology.",
    "nBackScience2": "Working memory is a cognitive system that temporarily holds information available for processing. It's crucial for reasoning, comprehension, learning, and many everyday tasks.",
    "nBackScience3": "Research suggests that regular training with the N-Back task may improve working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, and attention control.",
